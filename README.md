# âœ” About me

I am Jimmy Pham, an aspiring Computer Science student with some experience in multiple outlets of Comp Sci currently pursuing my Bachalors of Science at California State University, Fullerton.

I enjoy spending time and am highly passionate of learning about new technology. In 2021, I learned MySql, Python, and Algorithms. Towards the beginning of 2022, I practice and leanred more of Cyber Security, Computer Networking, Game and Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. From now to the end of 2022, I will have learned Cloud Computing and Security, Blockchain Technology, and Mobile Dev (with a concentration in Andriod).

Outside of work, I usually enjoy spending time hanging out with friends as well as learn about a new topic or skill unrelated to technology. I have recently been learning about more skills about cooking and having time to hang-out with my friends wether it's online or in-person. 

I also would to Travel more often each year. My recent trip was a family trip to Hawaii.
